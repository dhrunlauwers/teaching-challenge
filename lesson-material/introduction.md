## What is data wrangling?

![](./images/wrangler.jpg)

Data wrangling is the process of accessing and transforming data so that the result can be easily summarized and used for analysis and other purposes.

Data can come in various forms and can be accessed in several different ways, but the process of cleaning and transforming data stays more or less the same.

### Why is it an important skill?

> 80% of the data analysis process is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data

Data sources used in academics tend to be pre-processed and much cleaner than data used in the industry, so this is a very important skill to develop when you start working in the field.

Data preparation is not just a first step, but must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected.

For some general guidelines on what clean data really means, check out the referenes section below.

## What is Pandas?

Pandas is the most widely used data analysis library created for Python, and it has many built-in functions that will help with data wrangling.

As with all libraries, it's important to get some practice using them and to make sure to read the documentation. See the references section for a link to the official Pandas documentation, as well as some links to practice courses.

### Data structures

Pandas is short for *'panel-data'*, which refers to the nature of the way data is stored in Pandas.

Pandas allows us to store our data in different data structures represented by Python objects, and to perform operations on these objects. The most common data structures include:
1. Series: A one-dimensional array of data with labels. 
2. DataFrame: A two-dimensional array of data with labelled rows and columns.

### Common functions

Once our data is stored in one of the two data structures, pandas has many different functions we can use to manipulate and summarize data. This not only includes operations on a single data structure, like adding, removing data and summarizing data, but also includes operations on multiple data structures to combine them.

For a complete list of all functions, see Pandas documentation in the references section below.
