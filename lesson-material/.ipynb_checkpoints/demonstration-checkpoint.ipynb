    "## Case Study - Analysis of NYC 311 Service Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study is adopted from chapters 2 and 3 of Julia Evans' Pandas Cookbook. The original version you can find on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will look at the 311 Service Requests dataset published by New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are 311 Service Requests?\n",
    "\n",
    "311 Service Requests are requests made by residents for city services such as noise complains, or issues with water and utilities. Each request is recorded along with several pieces of associated information such as the type of request and where in the city the request originated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "The current dataset includes more than 17 million rows of data and contains data from 2010 to the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset is updated daily and can be accessed [on the NYC Open Data Wesbite](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look into a small subset of this data: all complaints for the month of April 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question we will try to answer with the analysis of the 311 NYC data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What part of the city has the most noise complaints on Sunday?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 - Reading the data\n",
    "For this demonstration, we have saved the data in the form of a zipped csv file in the 'data' folder of the repository associated with this lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "File: [311_Service_Requests_APRIL2018.zip](./data/311_Service_Requests_APRIL2018.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have read the data, it's a good idea to check the `head`, `shape`, and `info` of the result to make sure all rows and columns have been captured.\n",
    "- `head` or `tail` will show the first or last few records of your DataFrame\n",
    "- `shape` will show you the number of rows and columns\n",
    "- `info` will show you the columns and their respective data types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** \n",
    "- Make sure that the file is in the correct folder or update the path in the read_csv() function to include the correct path to the file. \n",
    "- The `pd.read_csv` command has [many options](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) that allow you to control how the file is read. For example, some files will have headers while others won't. Pandas will try to detect these things automatically, but in some cases you may need to play around wiht the options to get it just right."
